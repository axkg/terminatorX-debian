Description: A realtime audio synthesizer
 terminatorX is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to
 "scratch" on digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.mp3, etc.)
 the way hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl records. It features multiple
 turntables, realtime effects (built-in as well as LADSPA plugin
 effects), a sequencer and an easy-to-use gtk+ GUI.
