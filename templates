_Description: Install terminatorX SUID root so it can use realtime scheduling?
 TerminatorX now supports installation of its binary SUID root.  This
 allows it to run in a realtime scheduled priority thereby greatly
 improving performance.  However, it is generally a good idea to minimize
 the number of SUID programs on your machine to avoid security risks.

 If you are installing this on your personal desktop with only 1 user, it
 should be fairly safe to accept here. If in doubt, refuse.
